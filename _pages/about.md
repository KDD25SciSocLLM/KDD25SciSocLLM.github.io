subtitle: WWW’24 Workshop Proposal DCAI Data-centric Artificial Intelligence
---

### ABSTRACT

The emergence of Data-centric AI (DCAI) represents a pivotal shift in AI development, redirecting focus from model refinement to prioritizing data quality. This paradigmatic transition emphasizes the critical role of data in AI. While past approaches centered on refining models, they often overlooked potential data imperfections, raising questions about the true potential of enhanced model performance. DCAI advocates the systematic engineering of data, complementing existing efforts and playing a vital role in driving AI success. This transition has spurred innovation in various machine learning and data mining algorithms and their applications on the Web. Therefore, we propose the DCAI Workshop at WWW’24, which offers a platform for academic researchers and industry practitioners to showcase the latest advancements in DCAI research and their practical applications in the real world.

### OBJECTIVES

Data-centric AI (DCAI) [11, 12] is a burgeoning concept that shifts our attention from advancing model design towards the pursuit of data excellence, which marks a significant surge in recognizing the crucial importance of data in the realm of AI. In the past, AI was predominantly viewed through a model-centric lens, with a primary focus on refining model designs to boost AI performance using fixed datasets. However, this approach tends to neglect potential data imperfections, such as missing values, incorrect labels, and anomalies. This raises the critical question of whether the numerous enhancements in model performance authentically reflect the model’s true potential, or if they are merely a consequence of overfitting to the dataset. DCAI represents an emerging frontier that complements existing efforts, underscoring the systematic engineering of data in AI development1 , and plays an increasingly important role in propelling AI to success.

The transition to DCAI has ignited a wave of innovation in machine learning and data mining algorithms. These encompass a spectrum of cutting-edge techniques such as graph learning [3, 4, 10, 14, 15], trustworthy machine learning [6], and Large Language Models (LLMs) [5, 7]. These advancements have found applications not only in computer science but have also permeated diverse domains including finance [8], information systems [2], mechanical engineering [9], robotic [1], and beyond. In this workshop, our objective is to delve into the recent advances in both the theoretical underpinnings and practical applications of DCAI.

### TOPICS

We enthusiastically invite submissions that focus on recent breakthroughs in the research and development of DCAI, coupled with their real-world applications. Contributions in the form of theory, methodology, and application papers are encouraged from areas including but not limited to: 

- Data Augmentation Methods
- Efficient Data Labeling Methods
- Data Collection Strategies
- Anomaly Detection and Label Correction Methods
- Data Engineering Methods (e.g., Data Cleaning, Data Imputation, Feature Selection, Dimension Reduction)
- Data-centric Methods for Graphs (e.g., Graph Structure Learning, Graph Augmentation, Graph Condensation)
- Data-centric Methods for Machine Learning Robustness, Security, Interpretability, and Fairness.
- Data-centric Methods for Large Language Models (e.g., Training Data Curation, Evaluation Data Construction, and Prompt Engineering) 
- Data-centric Methods in other domains (e.g., finance, information systems, mechanical engineering, robotics, etc.)
- Proposing New Datasets or Benchmarks 

The relevant topics are not confined to those listed above. We welcome all contributions that are pertinent to the WWW community, with a focus on developing, iterating, and maintaining data to drive its advancement and help build better AI algorithms.

### TENTATIVE FORMAT AND SCHEDULE

The full day workshop schedule is planned with two half-day sessions that will be split by the conference planned lunch break.

Note that our tentative schedule currently has this planned for 12:30-13:30, but we will update accordingly once provided further guidance as to the standardized workshop schedule for WWW’24.

Our program will consist of the following main components: 1) invited keynotes from experts in the field of data-centric AI coming from both industry and academia to create a synergistic atmosphere and to stimulate collaborations, 2) contributed research oral talks selected from the set of accepted works into DCAI, 3) future directions panel discussion that will be composed of our keynote speakers given their expertise in this domain, 4) contributed poster sessions both before lunch and after the final remarks to allow all those with works accepted into the workshop (not just those selected for oral talks) to present their work and socialize stimulating new ideas and potential collaborations.
