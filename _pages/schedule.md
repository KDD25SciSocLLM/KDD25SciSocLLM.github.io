Note that our tentative schedule currently has this planned for 13:00-17:00, but we will update accordingly once provided further guidance as to the standardized workshop schedule for KDD’25).

Our program will consist of the following main components: 1) invited keynotes from experts in the field of AI4Science coming from both industry and academia to create a synergistic
atmosphere and to stimulate collaborations, 2) contributed research oral talks selected from the set of accepted
works into SciSoc LLM, 3) future directions panel discussion that will be composed of our keynote speakers given their expertise in this domain, and 4) contributed poster sessions both before lunch and after the final remarks to allow all those with works accepted into the workshop (not just those selected for oral talks) to present their work and socialize stimulating new ideas and potential collaborations.

The 6-hour event excluding coffee and lunch breaks is scheduled
as follows:
- 13:00 - 13:10 Welcome & Opening Remarks
- 13:10 - 13:50 Keynote I
- 13:50 - 14:20 Contributed Research Oral Talks I
- 14:20 - 15:00 Keynote II
- 15:00 - 15:30 Coffee break/Social Networking
- 15:30 - 16:10 Contributed Research Oral Talks II
- 16:00 - 16:10 Best Paper Award Ceremony & Final Remarks
- 16:10 - 17:00 Contributed Research Poster Session


#### Selection Process 

Keynote Speakers & Panelists. The keynote speakers from both academia and industry are planned to be well-recognized in the machine learning and data mining community, especially in the subcommunity focused on LLMs for Science and Society. Some of the invited keynote speakers have already agreed upon, and they have accepted conditional on the acceptance of our proposed SciSoc LLM workshop at KDD’25. The remaining keynote speakers and panelists will be selected by the SciSoc LLM organization committee and will ensure a balanced distribution of those coming from industry and academia.

Submissions & Review Process. The workshop CFP is for paper submissions that will undergo the standard double-blind peerreview process to avoid biases. We will utilize OpenReview for managing submissions and reviews. We will invite a well-experienced set of program committee members for SciSoc LLM to first guarantee each paper submission will be reviewed by at least two PC members and second to ensure an informed and fair evaluation of the work being submitted. Based upon the reviews provided by PC members, the final recommendation of acceptance or rejection to SciSoc LLM at KDD’25 will be made by the workshop organizers. The detailed review comments and notification letter will be sent to the authors accordingly along with detailed information as to whether they have been accepted for an oral or poster presentation (as noted above in the tentative workshop schedule).
